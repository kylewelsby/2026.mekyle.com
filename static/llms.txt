## Positioning

I approach every system like I own the company. That conviction, combined with 15 years building platforms where correctness, security and cost matter as much as speed, helps teams navigate uncertainty and ship with confidence.

## Professional Summary

Kyle Welsby is a Senior Software Engineer operating at Staff level: setting technical direction, aligning cross-functional stakeholders, and making the high-judgment trade-offs that shape platforms. Based in Manchester, UK. Open to relocation.

His work spans fintech, regulated systems and AI-first platforms. He specialises in finding structural problems early: mapping hidden state complexity, advocating for architecture decisions that compound, and creating the clarity that lets teams move fast.

## Impact Narratives

### AI-First Platform Architecture — Ophelos

**Role:** Founding AI Engineer, Technical Architect

**The problem:** Platform treated debt cases as binary (open/closed), obscuring the actual journey complexity. Business logic was buried in code that couldn't support AI-first operations.

**What Kyle did:** Conducted stakeholder interviews and deep code investigation to map hidden state complexity. Identified multiple intermediate states and terminal outcomes. Advocated for build-over-buy on communications, recognising AI-first systems need internal data access. Led 8-week intensive build phase with cross-functional team of 10.

**Outcome:** Platform now supports millions of debt cases and hundreds of thousands of AI-mediated interactions across 7 European markets. Discovery work became the foundation for the company's core pivot to AI-first operations.

**Technologies:** Go, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Server-Sent Events, State Machines

### Shipping Performance at Scale — Shopify

**Role:** Technical Lead (team of 6)

**The problem:** Checkout performance at Shopify's scale: millions of merchants, production constraints, high stakes.

**What Kyle did:** Led technical delivery for team of 6. Owned scope and sequencing for shipping platform optimisations. Used data to reframe approach when unforeseen production constraints emerged. Maintained team morale through project uncertainty.

**Outcome:** Achieved ~2% checkout performance improvement at scale. Delivered quality work despite project eventually being stopped due to external unknowns.

**Technologies:** Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, Distributed Systems

### Engineering Culture Contributions

**Traffic Light Code Review System:** Created an accessibility-conscious code review technique:
- Red Square — Cannot approve until critical issues resolved
- Amber Triangle — Would like improvement; can proceed if pressed
- Green Circle — Minor nit-pick, noting for next time

Adopted organically across teams. Addresses cognitive load and colour-blind accessibility through shape differentiation.

**Mentorship:** Mentored George Holborn from Software Engineer to Senior in under 2 years through pairing and psychological safety. He later joined another company at Senior level with confidence.
