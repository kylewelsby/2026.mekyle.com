# 2026.mekyle.com 🏔️

A Nordic-inspired portfolio rebuild. But this repo isn't just the finished site: it's the entire process of building it.

## 👋 Welcome to the Open Kitchen

You're looking at everything: the initial prompts, the specifications, the design decisions and the AI collaboration instructions. Not just polished code, but the messy reality of how software gets made.

Why expose all this?

Because after 25+ years of writing code, I've learnt something important: **knowing what to build matters as much as knowing how to build it**. The typing is the easy part. The thinking is where projects succeed or fail.

Most portfolios show you the finished meal. This one lets you watch the cooking.

## 🧠 What This Repo Demonstrates

**Spec-Driven Development** using [OpenSpec](./openspec/AGENTS.md): writing detailed specifications before touching code. This prevents the classic mistake of building the wrong thing really efficiently.

**AI-Assisted Development** with transparent prompting. The `CLAUDE.md` file contains every instruction given to AI tools. No magic, no hidden context: just clear direction.

**Iterative Design Thinking** through change proposals that capture *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was decided.

## 📂 What You'll Find

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions for AI assistants |
| `INITIAL-PROMPT.md` | Comprehensive briefing on Zola, design and strategy |

| `openspec/changes/` | Active work: proposals, designs and task breakdowns |
