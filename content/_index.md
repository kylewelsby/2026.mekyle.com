I'm a technical architect who owns system-level decisions and makes high-judgment trade-offs under uncertainty. My speciality is greenfield architecture: designing state-driven systems, financially auditable ledgers, and platforms that need to pass regulatory scrutiny.

Currently at Ophelos (Intrum) acting as Principal Engineer, previously at Shopify as Senior Software Engineer, with a background in UK public sector and fintech contracts.

I believe the best systems are built with clear specifications, tested ruthlessly, and designed to be boring: predictable, observable, and maintainable by anyone on the team.
