company = "Ophelos"
role = "Founding AI Engineer, Technical Architect"
problem = "Platform treated debt cases as binary (open/closed), obscuring the actual journey complexity. Business logic was buried in code that couldn't support AI-first operations."
solution = "Conducted stakeholder interviews and deep code investigation to map hidden state complexity. Identified multiple intermediate states and terminal outcomes. Advocated for build-over-buy on communications, recognising AI-first systems need internal data access. Led 8-week intensive build phase with cross-functional team of 10."
outcome = "Platform now supports millions of debt cases and hundreds of thousands of AI-mediated interactions across 7 European markets. Discovery work became the foundation for the company's core pivot to AI-first operations."

Addresses cognitive load and colour-blind accessibility through shape differentiation. Mentored George Holborn from Software Engineer to Senior in under 2 years through pairing and psychological safety."

I'm a Senior Software Engineer who operates at Staff level: setting technical direction, aligning cross-functional stakeholders, and making the high-judgment trade-offs that shape platforms.

My work spans fintech, regulated systems and AI-first platforms. I specialise in finding structural problems early: mapping hidden state complexity, advocating for architecture decisions that compound, and creating the clarity that lets teams move fast.

I make engineering teams more effective. Through mentorship that accelerates careers, code review systems that spread organically, and technical conviction that helps teams navigate uncertainty.
